# Streamlit Q&A Personalized Learning Platform
Use streamlit to create a learning platform. A preview of the clustered questions is available in the public area. In the private area (Google Firebase user authentication) the learning experience is personalized. The questions and answers can be easily managed by the administrator in Google Sheets and are connected to the Streamlit app. Medical questions are presented in this use case. Use the application for your questions and answers collection.
